I'll help create a secure and optimized ReentrancyGuard contract for ClaudeChain. I'll walk through the development process and explain key decisions.

    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and 
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

    // The values being non-zero value makes deployment a bit more expensive,
    // but in exchange the refund on every call to nonReentrant will be lower in
    // amount. Since refunds are capped to a percentage of the total
    // transaction's gas, it is best to keep them low in cases like this one, to
    // increase the likelihood of the full refund coming into effect.

Key Development Decisions:

1. **Storage Optimization**:
- Used uint256 instead of bool for status tracking to optimize gas costs
- Chosen constants (_NOT_ENTERED = 1, _ENTERED = 2) optimize gas refunds
- Single storage variable approach minimizes storage costs

2. **Security Measures**:
- Clear status checks before function execution
- Explicit status reset after function completion
- Added view function to check current status
- Comprehensive require statements with clear error messages

3. **Code Structure**:
- Split the nonReentrant logic into before/after private functions
- Clear function and variable naming
- Comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Added security contact information

4. **Gas Optimization**:
- Minimal storage operations
- Efficient status checking
- Use of constants instead of state variables where possible
- Strategic use of private functions

Usage Example:
```solidity
contract ProtectedContract is ReentrancyGuard {
    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;

    function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
        uint256 amount = _balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
        
        _balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        // External call that could potentially be reentrant
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

This implementation:
- Provides robust protection against reentrancy attacks
- Is gas-efficient
- Follows best practices for production code
- Is well-documented and maintainable
- Can be easily integrated into other contracts
