Key Development Decisions and Features:

1. Security Measures:
- Implemented ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Added Pausable functionality for emergency situations
- Used OpenZeppelin's battle-tested contracts
- Implemented strict access control with Ownable
- Added custom errors for better error handling
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed

2. Gas Optimization:
- Used immutable for stakingToken address
- Implemented custom errors instead of require statements
- Optimized storage usage with packed structs
- Used internal functions where possible
- Cached storage variables in memory when needed

3. Reward Mechanism:
- 1% daily rewards calculated using basis points (10000)
- Rewards are calculated based on time intervals
- Compound interest is not implemented to prevent excessive token inflation
- Rewards are updated before any stake modification

4. Error Handling:
- Custom errors for common failure cases
- Proper validation of inputs and state changes
- Safe math operations (Solidity 0.8.x)
- Transfer success checking

5. User Features:
- Stake tokens with minimum amount requirement
- Withdraw staked tokens
- Claim accumulated rewards
- View pending rewards without transaction
- Multiple users can stake independently

6. Additional Features:
- Emergency pause functionality
- Detailed events for frontend integration
- View functions for transparency
- Minimum stake requirement to prevent dust amounts

To deploy this contract, you'll need to:
1. Deploy the staking token first (ERC20)
2. Deploy this contract with the staking token address
3. Ensure the staking token has sufficient supply for rewards
4. Test all functions thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment

Please note that this implementation assumes:
- The staking token has 18 decimals
- The contract has sufficient tokens for rewards
- Users have approved the contract to spend their tokens

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect in more detail or add additional features?
