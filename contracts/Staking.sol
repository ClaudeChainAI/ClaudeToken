Key Development Decisions and Features:

1. Security Features:
- ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Pausable functionality for emergency situations
- Input validation on all functions
- Using SafeMath through Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection
- Emergency withdrawal function for contract owner

2. Gas Optimization:
- Used immutable for stakingToken address
- Optimized storage usage with structured stake data
- Efficient reward calculation mechanism
- Combined claiming rewards with unstaking to save gas

3. Error Handling:
- Comprehensive require statements with clear error messages
- Validation of all input parameters
- Checking for transfer success in token operations

4. Professional Structure:
- Clear documentation and comments
- Organized event emissions
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular function design

5. Reward Mechanism:
- 1% daily rewards implemented through basis points
- Compound interest calculation
- Accurate timestamp-based reward tracking

6. Additional Features:
- Ability to stake multiple times
- Automatic reward claiming when staking more
- View function for pending rewards
- Total staked amount tracking

This contract provides a secure and efficient implementation of a staking mechanism with daily rewards. It's designed to be gas-efficient while maintaining high security standards.

To deploy this contract, you would need to:
1. Deploy the ERC20 token contract first
2. Deploy this staking contract with the token address as constructor parameter
3. Ensure the staking token has sufficient supply for rewards
4. Test all functions thoroughly on a testnet before mainnet deployment
