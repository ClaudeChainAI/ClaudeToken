Key Development Decisions and Security Considerations:

1. Security Features:
- Used OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Implemented Pausable functionality for emergency situations
- Added emergency withdrawal function for the owner
- Careful ordering of state changes before external calls
- Input validation and require statements

2. Gas Optimization:
- Used immutable for stakingToken address
- Optimized storage usage with structured stake information
- Implemented efficient reward calculation mechanism
- Used internal functions to reduce code duplication

3. Error Handling:
- Comprehensive require statements with clear error messages
- Proper checking of transfer results
- Validation of constructor parameters

4. Features:
- Compound daily rewards at 1%
- Ability to stake multiple times
- Automatic reward claiming before new stakes
- Flexible unstaking mechanism
- View function for pending rewards

5. Events:
- Comprehensive event emission for all important actions
- Indexed parameters for efficient filtering

The contract implements a compound interest model for rewards, where users earn 1% daily on their staked amounts. The rewards are calculated based on the time elapsed since the last claim and are automatically claimed when staking more tokens or unstaking.

This implementation is production-ready but should undergo thorough testing and auditing before deployment. Consider these additional recommendations:

1. Implement rate limiting for large transactions
2. Add more detailed documentation
3. Consider adding a maximum stake limit
4. Implement a more granular reward distribution system
5. Add additional admin controls for reward rate adjustment
