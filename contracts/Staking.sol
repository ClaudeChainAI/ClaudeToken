Key Design Decisions and Security Considerations:

1. Security Features:
- Used OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Implemented Pausable functionality for emergency situations
- Added access control with Ownable
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed
- Input validation on all public functions

2. Gas Optimization:
- Used a struct to pack related data and reduce storage operations
- Immutable variables where possible
- Minimized state changes and storage operations
- Used private constants for fixed values

3. Error Handling:
- Comprehensive require statements with clear error messages
- Validation of all inputs and state changes
- Safe math operations using Solidity 0.8.x built-in overflow checks

4. Professional Structure:
- Clear function organization
- Detailed NatSpec comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Events for important state changes
- Modular and maintainable code

5. Additional Features:
- Daily rewards calculation based on time elapsed
- Flexible withdrawal system
- Reward claiming mechanism
- Total staked tracking

Testing Considerations:
1. Test all state transitions
2. Verify reward calculations
3. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Ensure proper access control
5. Verify event emissions

This implementation provides a secure and efficient staking mechanism for ClaudeChain. The code is production-ready but should undergo thorough testing and auditing before deployment.
