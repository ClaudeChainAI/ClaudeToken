I'll help develop the Ownable.sol contract with a focus on security, gas optimization, and best practices. I'll explain my thought process and key decisions throughout.

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    error SameOwnerAddress();

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.
     */

        _owner = msg.sender;

        _;
    }

    /**

    function owner() public view returns (address) {
        return _owner;
    }

    /**

    function pendingOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return _pendingOwner;

    /**
     * @dev Initiates the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`).
     * Can only be called by the current owner.

     */
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        if (newOwner == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        if (newOwner == _owner) revert SameOwnerAddress();
        
        _pendingOwner = newOwner;

        if (msg.sender != _pendingOwner) revert NotPendingOwner();

        address oldOwner = _owner;
        _owner = _pendingOwner;
        _pendingOwner = address(0);

        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, _owner);
    }

    /**

     */
    function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {
        address oldOwner = _owner;
        _owner = address(0);

Key Design Decisions and Features:

1. **Two-Step Ownership Transfer**:
- Implemented a secure two-step ownership transfer process
- Requires explicit acceptance from the new owner
- Prevents accidental transfers to wrong addresses
- Allows the new owner to verify they have control of the address

2. **Gas Optimization**:
- Used custom errors instead of require statements
- Minimized storage operations
- Used private variables with public getter functions
- Efficient event emission

3. **Security Features**:
- Checks for zero address
- Prevents transfer to same address
- Clear ownership state management
- Complete event logging for transparency

4. **Error Handling**:
- Custom errors for each failure case
- Clear, specific error messages
- Proper access control checks

5. **Events**:
- OwnershipTransferred for final transfers
- OwnershipTransferInitiated for transfer initiation
- Indexed parameters for efficient filtering

The contract follows these best practices:
- Implements common security patterns
- Uses latest Solidity features (0.8.17)
- Follows standard naming conventions
- Includes comprehensive documentation
- Provides clear state management

Usage Example:
```solidity
// Deploy contract
Ownable ownable = new Ownable();

// Transfer ownership
ownable.transferOwnership(newOwner);

// New owner accepts
// (must be called from newOwner address)
ownable.acceptOwnership();
```

This implementation provides a secure and gas-efficient way to manage contract ownership in the ClaudeChain ecosystem. It can be inherited by other contracts that need ownership functionality.
