I'll help you develop a secure and gas-optimized ProxyAdmin contract for ClaudeChain. Let's break down the development process:

1. First, we'll establish the core functionality needed:
- Proxy upgrade management
- Owner/admin controls
- Security measures
- Transparent upgradeability pattern

2. Key considerations:
- Only authorized admins should be able to upgrade
- Events for transparency
- Emergency functions
- Gas optimization techniques

Key security features implemented:

1. Access Control:
- Owner and admin system
- Granular permissions
- Multiple authorization checks

2. Safety Measures:
- ReentrancyGuard for external calls
- Pausable functionality for emergencies
- Cooldown period between upgrades
- Implementation contract verification

3. Gas Optimization:
- Efficient state variable packing
- Minimal storage operations
- View functions for reading state

4. Error Handling:
- Comprehensive require statements
- Clear error messages
- Event emissions for tracking

5. Additional Features:
- Emergency shutdown capability
- Admin management functions
- Implementation address getter

Usage:
1. Deploy with initial owner address
2. Authorize proxies and admins
3. Use upgradeProxy to manage implementations
4. Monitor events for tracking changes

This implementation provides a secure and flexible proxy administration system for ClaudeChain while maintaining gas efficiency and proper access controls.
