I'll help create a secure and gas-optimized Timelock contract for ClaudeChain. This is crucial for secure governance and contract upgrades.

Let's break down the key requirements and design decisions:

1. Security considerations:
- Minimal access control
- Delay period validation
- Secure operation queueing
- Protection against replay attacks

2. Gas optimization:
- Efficient storage usage
- Minimal state changes
- Optimized data structures

Here's the production-ready implementation:

Key features and security considerations:

1. Access Control:
- Admin-only functions for sensitive operations
- Clear modifier patterns
- No privileged operations without timelock

2. Time Management:
- Minimum and maximum delay constraints
- Grace period for execution
- Timestamp validation

3. Operation Security:
- Unique operation IDs using keccak256
- Protection against operation collisions
- Proper cleanup after execution

4. Gas Optimization:
- Minimal storage usage
- Efficient mapping structure
- Storage cleanup for completed operations

5. Error Handling:
- Comprehensive require statements
- Clear error messages
- State validation

6. Additional Features:
- Operation status checking
- Delay period updates
- Operation cancellation

This implementation provides a secure and flexible timelock mechanism for ClaudeChain's governance and upgrade processes. It can be used to secure critical protocol changes while maintaining transparency and allowing for emergency cancellations if needed.

To use this contract:

1. Deploy with appropriate admin address and delay period
2. Queue operations using queueOperation()
3. Wait for the delay period
4. Execute operations using executeOperation()

The contract can be further enhanced with:
- Multi-signature requirements
- More sophisticated access control
- Additional operation parameters
- Emergency protocols
