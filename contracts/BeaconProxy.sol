I'll help you develop a secure and gas-optimized BeaconProxy implementation for ClaudeChain. Let's break this down into steps and create the necessary contracts.

First, we'll need three contracts:
1. IBeacon interface
2. BeaconProxy contract
3. UpgradeableBeacon contract

Here's the implementation:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

/**
 * @title IBeacon
 * @dev Interface for the Beacon contract that holds the implementation address
 */
interface IBeacon {
    function implementation() external view returns (address);
}

/**
 * @title BeaconProxy
 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that gets the implementation address from a beacon contract.
 * It includes safety checks and optimal gas usage patterns.
 */
contract BeaconProxy {
    // Storage slot with the address of the current beacon
    bytes32 private constant BEACON_SLOT = keccak256("eip1967.proxy.beacon");

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the proxy with a beacon.
     * @param beacon Address of the beacon
     */
    constructor(address beacon) {
        assert(BEACON_SLOT == bytes32(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.beacon")) - 1));
        _setBeacon(beacon);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Fallback function that delegates calls to the beacon's implementation address.
     */
    fallback() external payable {
        _delegate(_implementation());
    }

    /**
     * @dev Receive function to accept ETH
     */
    receive() external payable {
        _delegate(_implementation());
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the current beacon address.
     */
    function _getBeacon() private view returns (address) {
        return address(uint160(uint256(StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(BEACON_SLOT).value)));
    }

    /**
     * @dev Sets the beacon address.
     * @param beacon Address of the beacon contract
     */
    function _setBeacon(address beacon) private {
        require(beacon != address(0), "BeaconProxy: beacon is zero address");
        require(
            AddressUtils.isContract(beacon),
            "BeaconProxy: beacon is not a contract"
        );
        StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(BEACON_SLOT).value = beacon;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the current implementation address from the beacon.
     */
    function _implementation() private view returns (address) {
        address beacon = _getBeacon();
        address impl = IBeacon(beacon).implementation();
        require(
            impl != address(0) && AddressUtils.isContract(impl),
            "BeaconProxy: invalid implementation"
        );
        return impl;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Delegates the current call to implementation.
     * @param implementation Address to delegate.
     */
    function _delegate(address implementation) private {
        assembly {
            // Copy msg.data. We take full control of memory in this inline assembly
            // block because it will not return to Solidity code. We overwrite the
            // Solidity scratch pad at memory position 0.
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())

            // Call the implementation.
            // out and outsize are 0 because we don't know the size yet.
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), implementation, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)

            // Copy the returned data.
            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())

            switch result
            // delegatecall returns 0 on error.
            case 0 {
                revert(0, returndatasize())
            }
            default {
                return(0, returndatasize())
            }
        }
    }
}

/**
 * @title UpgradeableBeacon
 * @dev This contract holds the implementation address for proxy contracts.
 */
contract UpgradeableBeacon is IBeacon {
    address private _implementation;
    address private immutable _owner;

    event Upgraded(address indexed implementation);

    /**
     * @dev Sets the initial implementation address
     * @param implementation_ Address of the initial implementation
     */
    constructor(address implementation_) {
        _owner = msg.sender;
        _setImplementation(implementation_);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the current implementation address.
     */
    function implementation() public view override returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Upgrades the beacon to a new implementation.
     * @param newImplementation Address of the new implementation
     */
    function upgrade(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == _owner, "UpgradeableBeacon: caller is not the owner");
        _setImplementation(newImplementation);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Sets the implementation address
     * @param newImplementation Address of the new implementation
     */
    function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) private {
        require(
            AddressUtils.isContract(newImplementation),
            "UpgradeableBeacon: implementation is not a contract"
        );
        _implementation = newImplementation;
        emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
    }
}

/**
 * @title AddressUtils
 * @dev Collection of functions related to the address type
 */
library AddressUtils {
    /**
     * @dev Returns true if `account` is a contract.
     */
    function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(account)
        }
        return size > 0;
    }
}

/**
 * @title StorageSlot
 * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.
 */
library StorageSlot {
    struct AddressSlot {
        address value;
    }

    function getAddressSlot(bytes32 slot) internal pure returns (AddressSlot storage r) {
        assembly {
            r.slot := slot
        }
    }
}
```

Key features and design decisions:

1. **Security**:
- Implementation of EIP-1967 storage slots to avoid storage collisions
- Strict input validation
- Access control for upgrades
- Contract existence checks
- Zero-address checks

2. **Gas Optimization**:
- Use of assembly for delegate calls
- Minimal storage usage
- Efficient memory management
- Single-slot storage patterns

3. **Error Handling**:
- Comprehensive require statements
- Clear error messages
- Proper revert handling in delegatecall

4. **Upgradability**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Immutable owner
- Events for tracking upgrades

To use this implementation:

1. Deploy the implementation contract (the contract you want to proxy to)
2. Deploy the UpgradeableBeacon with the implementation address
3. Deploy the BeaconProxy with the beacon address

Example usage:

```solidity
// 1. Deploy implementation
MyContract implementation = new MyContract();

// 2. Deploy beacon
UpgradeableBeacon beacon = new UpgradeableBeacon(address(implementation));

// 3. Deploy proxy
BeaconProxy proxy = new BeaconProxy(address(beacon));

// 4. Interact with proxy
MyContract(address(proxy)).someFunction();
```

This implementation provides a secure and gas-efficient way to manage upgradeable contracts in ClaudeChain, with the added benefit of being able to upgrade multiple proxies simultaneously through the beacon pattern.
